  desc: GridLayout is a layout in which images with the same width are arranged in a staggered arrangement, like a stack of bricks. Adjust the width of all images to the same size, find the lowest height column, and insert a new image.

  image: ./assets/image/JustifiedLayout.svg
  desc: \'justified\' is a printing term with the meaning that 'it fits in one row wide'. JustifiedLayout is a layout in which the image is filled up on the basis of a line given a width in the meaning of the term.

- name: FrameLayout
  image: ./assets/image/FrameLayout.svg
  desc: FrameLayout is a layout that allows you to place items in a given frame. It is a layout that corresponds to a level intermediate between the placement of the image directly by the designer and the layout using the algorithm.
  demos:
  - name: FrameLayout 1
    target: frame
  - name: Metro
    target: frame2
  - name: Calendar
    target: frame3
  - name: Timeline
    target: timeline
- name: SquareLayout
  image: ./assets/image/SquareLayout.svg
  desc: SquareLayout aligns the grid with all the images in a square like a checkerboard, and the important image is displayed by enlarging the size N times. The main image can be enlarged, and then a small image can be placed to naturally show the relationship of the image.
  demos:
  - name: SquareLayout 1
    target: square
- name: PackingLayout
  desc:  PackingLayout show important images bigger without sacrificing the inherent size of the image. Rows and columns are separated so that images are dynamically placed within the horizontal and vertical space rather than arranged in an orderly fashion.
